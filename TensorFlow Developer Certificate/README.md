# DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Certificate Course Structure

## About this Specialization
TensorFlow is one of the most in-demand and popular open-source deep learning frameworks available today. The DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program teaches you applied machine learning skills with TensorFlow so you can build and train powerful models.

In this hands-on, four-course Professional Certificate program, you’ll learn the necessary tools to build scalable AI-powered applications with TensorFlow. After finishing this program, you’ll be able to apply your new TensorFlow skills to a wide range of problems and projects. This program can help you prepare for the Google TensorFlow Certificate exam and bring you one step closer to achieving the Google TensorFlow Certificate.

## Applied Learning Project
In the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program, you'll get hands-on experience through 16 Python programming assignments. By the end of this program, you will be ready to:

- Build and train neural networks using TensorFlow
- Improve your network’s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images
- Teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems
- Process text, represent sentences as vectors, and train a model to create original poetry!

## Courses

- ### Course 1: Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
  - The Machine Learning course and Deep Learning Specialization from Andrew Ng teach the most important and foundational principles of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This new deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization teaches you how to use TensorFlow to implement those principles so that you can start building and applying scalable models to real-world problems. To develop a deeper understanding of how neural networks work, we recommend that you take the Deep Learning Specialization.
- ### Course 2: Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
  - In this course you will learn advanced techniques to improve the computer vision model you built in Course 1. You will explore how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout. Finally, Course 2 will introduce you to transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted from models.
- ### Course 3: Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
  - In this course you will build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow. You will learn to process text, including tokenizing and representing sentences as vectors, so that they can be input to a neural network. You’ll also learn to apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs in TensorFlow. Finally, you’ll get to train an LSTM on existing text to create original poetry!
- ### Course 4: Sequences, Time Series and Prediction
  - In this course you will learn how to build time series models in TensorFlow. You’ll first implement best practices to prepare time series data. You’ll also explore how RNNs and 1D ConvNets can be used for prediction. Finally, you’ll apply everything you’ve learned throughout the Specialization to build a sunspot prediction model using real-world data!
