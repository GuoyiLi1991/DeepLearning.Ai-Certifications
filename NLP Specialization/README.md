# Natural Language Processing Course Structure

## About this Specialization
**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human language. This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.

By the end of this Specialization, you will be ready to design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even build chatbots. These and other NLP applications are going to be at the forefront of the coming transformation to an AI-powered future.

This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the Deep Learning Specialization. Łukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper.

## Applied Learning Project
**This Specialization will equip you with the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques needed to build cutting-edge NLP systems:**

• Use logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies, and translate words, and use locality sensitive hashing for approximate nearest neighbors.

• Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and identify part-of-speech tags for words.

• Use dense and recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow and Trax to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions.

• Use encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention to perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences, text summarization, question-answering and to build chatbots. Models covered include T5, BERT, transformer, reformer, and more!

## Courses

- ### Course 1: NLP with Classification and Vector Spaces
  - ##### In this course, you will perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then naïve Bayes, use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search. 
- ### Course 2: NLP with Probabilistic Models
  - ##### In this course, you will: create a simple auto-correct algorithm using minimum edit distance and dynamic programming, apply the Viterbi Algorithm for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which is important for computational linguistics, write a better auto-complete algorithm using an N-gram language model, and write your own Word2Vec model that uses a neural network to compute word embeddings using a continuous bag-of-words model.
- ### Course 3: NLP with with Sequence Models
  - ##### In this course, you will: train a neural network with GLoVe word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets, generate synthetic Shakespeare text using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) language model, train a recurrent neural network to perform named entity recognition (NER) using LSTMs with linear layers, and use so-called ‘Siamese’ LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning. 
- ### Course 4: NLP with Attention Models
  - ##### In this course, you will: translate complete English sentences into German using an encoder-decoder attention model, build a Transformer model to summarize text, use T5 and BERT models to perform question-answering, and build a chatbot using a Reformer model.
