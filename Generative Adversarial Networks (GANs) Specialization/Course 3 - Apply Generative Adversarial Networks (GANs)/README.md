# Course 3: Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Description
In Course 3 of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai, you will explore the applications of GANs and examine them wrt data augmentation, privacy, and anonymity, leverage the image-to-image translation framework and identify applications to modalities beyond images, implement Pix2Pix, a paired image-to-image translation GAN, to adapt satellite images into map routes (and vice versa), compare paired image-to-image translation to unpaired image-to-image translation and identify how their key difference necessitates different GAN architectures, implement CycleGAN, an unpaired image-to-image translation model, to adapt horses to zebras (and vice versa) with two GANs in one

- #### Week 1: GANs for Data Augmentation and Privacy
	- Learn different applications of GANs, understand the pros/cons of using them for data augmentation, and see how they can improve downstream AI models!
- #### Week 2: Image-to-Image Translation with Pix2Pix
	- Understand image-to-image translation, learn about different applications of this framework, and implement a U-Net generator and Pix2Pix, a paired image-to-image translation GAN!
- #### Week 3: Unpaired Translation with CycleGAN
	- Understand how unpaired image-to-image translation differs from paired translation, learn how CycleGAN implements this model using two GANs, and implement a CycleGAN to transform between horses and zebras!
