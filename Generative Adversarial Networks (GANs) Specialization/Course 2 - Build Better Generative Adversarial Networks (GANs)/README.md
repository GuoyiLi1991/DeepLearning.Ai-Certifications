# Course 2: Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Description
In Course 2 of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai, you will assess the challenges of evaluating GANs and compare different generative models, use the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) method to evaluate the fidelity and diversity of GANs, identify sources of bias and the ways to detect it in GANs, learn and implement the techniques associated with the state-of-the-art StyleGANs

- #### Week 1: Evaluation of GANs
	- Understand the challenges of evaluating GANs, learn about the advantages and disadvantages of different GAN performance measures, and implement the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) method using embeddings to assess the accuracy of GANs!
- #### Week 2: GAN Disadvantages and Bias
	- Learn the disadvantages of GANs when compared to other generative models, discover the pros/cons of these models—plus, learn about the many places where bias in machine learning can come from, why it’s important, and an approach to identify it in GANs!
- #### Week 3: StyleGAN and Advancements
	- Learn how StyleGAN improves upon previous models and implement the components and the techniques associated with StyleGAN, currently the most state-of-the-art GAN with powerful capabilities!
